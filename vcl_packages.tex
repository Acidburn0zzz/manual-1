Various extra packages are available with code for special applications. 
Some of these packages are stored at 
\url{https://github.com/vectorclass/add-on}.
Manuals are included with each package. The add-on packages for VCL include:

\begin{description}

\item[Random number generator.] 
   A high-quality pseudo random number generator. Capable of generating random integer and floating point vectors. Suitable for large multi-threaded applications.

\item[Decimal string conversion.] 
   Converts integer vectors to and from comma-separated lists in human-readable decimal ASCII form. Useful for reading and writing comma-separated files.

\item[3-dimensional vectors.] 
   Defines 3-dimensional vectors for use in geometry and physics. 
   Includes operators and functions for addition, multiplication, dot product, cross product, and rotation.
   
\item[Complex number vectors.]    
   Defines complex number vectors for use in mathematics and electronics. 
   Includes operators for add, subtract, multiply, divide, and conjugate, as well as functions such as complex square root, exponential function, and logarithm.
   
\item[Quaternions.]    
   Defines quaternions (hypercomplex numbers) for use in mathematics.
   Includes operators for add, subtract, multiply, divide, conjugate, etc.
